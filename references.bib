@article{AgapiouEtAl_ImportanceSamplingIntrinsic_2015,
	abstract = {The basic idea of importance sampling is to use independent samples from a proposal measure in order to approximate expectations with respect to a target measure. It is key to understand how many samples are required in order to guarantee accurate approximations. Intuitively, some notion of distance between the target and the proposal should determine the computational cost of the method. A major challenge is to quantify this distance in terms of parameters or statistics that are pertinent for the practitioner. The subject has attracted substantial interest from within a variety of communities. The objective of this paper is to overview and unify the resulting literature by creating an overarching framework. A general theory is presented, with a focus on the use of importance sampling in Bayesian inverse problems and filtering.},

@article{AuBeck_EstimationSmallFailure_2001,
	abstract = {A new simulation approach, called `subset simulation', is proposed to compute small failure probabilities encountered in reliability analysis of engineering systems. The basic idea is to express the failure probability as a product of larger conditional failure probabilities by introducing intermediate failure events. With a proper choice of the conditional events, the conditional failure probabilities can be made suf\textregistered ciently large so that they can be estimated by means of simulation with a small number of samples. The original problem of calculating a small failure probability, which is computationally demanding, is reduced to calculating a sequence of conditional probabilities, which can be readily and ef\textregistered ciently estimated by means of simulation. The conditional probabilities cannot be estimated ef\textregistered ciently by a standard Monte Carlo procedure, however, and so a Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) technique based on the Metropolis algorithm is presented for their estimation. The proposed method is robust to the number of uncertain parameters and ef\textregistered cient in computing small probabilities. The ef\textregistered ciency of the method is demonstrated by calculating the \textregistered rst-excursion probabilities for a linear oscillator subjected to white noise excitation and for a \textregistered ve-story nonlinear hysteretic shear building under uncertain seismic excitation. q 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

@article{AuBeck_ImportantSamplingHigh_2003,
	abstract = {This paper draws attention to a fundamental problem that occurs in applying importance sampling to `high-dimensional' reliability problems, i.e., those with a large number of uncertain parameters. This question of applicability carries an important bearing on the potential use of importance sampling for solving dynamic first-excursion problems and static reliability problems for structures with a large number of uncertain structural model parameters. The conditions under which importance sampling is applicable in high dimensions are investigated, where the focus is put on the common case of standard Gaussian uncertain parameters. It is found that importance sampling densities using design points are applicable if the covariance matrix associated with each design point does not deviate significantly from the identity matrix. The study also suggests that importance sampling densities using random pre-samples are generally not applicable in high dimensions.},

The original version of Subset Simulation, SubSim/MCMC, employs a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to simulate samples conditional on intermediate failure events; it is a general method that is applicable to all the benchmark problems. SubSim/Splitting is a variant of Subset Simulation applicable to first-passage problems involving deterministic dynamical systems. It makes use of trajectory splitting for generating conditional samples. Another variant, SubSim/ Hybrid, uses a combined MCMC/Splitting strategy and so it has the advantages of MCMC and splitting; it is applicable to uncertain and deterministic dynamical systems. Results show that all three Subset Simulation variants are effective in high-dimensional problems and that some computational efficiency can be gained by exploiting and incorporating system characteristics into the simulation procedure.},

@article{BalesdentEtAl_KrigingbasedAdaptiveImportance_2013,
	abstract = {Very efficient sampling algorithms have been proposed to estimate rare event probabilities, such as Importance Sampling or Importance Splitting. Even if the number of samples required to apply these techniques is relatively low compared to Monte-Carlo simulations of same efficiency, it is often difficult to implement them on time-consuming simulation codes. A joint use of sampling techniques and surrogate models may thus be of use. In this article, we develop a Kriging-based adaptive Importance Sampling approach for rare event probability estimation. The novelty resides in the use of adaptive Importance Sampling and consequently the ability to estimate very rare event probabilities (lower than 10\`A3) that have not been considered in previous work on similar subjects. The statistical properties of Kriging also make it possible to compute a confidence measure for the resulting estimation. Results on both analytical and engineering test cases show the efficiency of the approach in terms of accuracy and low number of samples.},

@incollection{BengtssonEtAl_CurseofdimensionalityRevisitedCollapse_2008,
	abstract = {It has been widely realized that Monte Carlo methods (approximation via a sample ensemble) may fail in large scale systems. This work offers some theoretical insight into this phenomenon in the context of the particle filter. We demonstrate that the maximum of the weights associated with the sample ensemble converges to one as both the sample size and the system dimension tends to infinity. Specifically, under fairly weak assumptions, if the ensemble size grows sub-exponentially in the cube root of the system dimension, the convergence holds for a single update step in state-space models with independent and identically distributed kernels. Further, in an important special case, more refined arguments show (and our simulations suggest) that the convergence to unity occurs unless the ensemble grows super-exponentially in the system dimension. The weight singularity is also established in models with more general multivariate likelihoods, e.g. Gaussian and Cauchy. Although presented in the context of atmospheric data assimilation for numerical weather prediction, our results are generally valid for high-dimensional particle filters.},

@article{BlatmanSudret_EfficientComputationGlobal_2010,
	abstract = {Global sensitivity analysis aims at quantifying the relative importance of uncertain input variables onto the response of a mathematical model of a physical system. ANOVA-based indices such as the Sobol' indices are well-known in this context. These indices are usually computed by direct Monte Carlo or quasi-Monte Carlo simulation, which may reveal hardly applicable for computationally demanding industrial models. In the present paper, sparse polynomial chaos (PC) expansions are introduced in order to compute sensitivity indices. An adaptive algorithm allows the analyst to build up a PC-based metamodel that only contains the significant terms whereas the PC coefficients are computed by leastsquare regression using a computer experimental design. The accuracy of the metamodel is assessed by leave-one-out cross validation. Due to the genuine orthogonality properties of the PC basis, ANOVAbased sensitivity indices are post-processed analytically. This paper also develops a bootstrap technique which eventually yields confidence intervals on the results. The approach is illustrated on various application examples up to 21 stochastic dimensions. Accurate results are obtained at a computational cost 2\textendash 3 orders of magnitude smaller than that associated with Monte Carlo simulation.},

@article{BotevKroese_EfficientAlgorithmRareevent_2008,
	abstract = {Although importance sampling is an established and effective sampling and estimation technique, it becomes unstable and unreliable for high-dimensional problems. The main reason is that the likelihood ratio in the importance sampling estimator degenerates when the dimension of the problem becomes large. Various remedies to this problem have been suggested, including heuristics such as resampling. Even so, the consensus is that for large-dimensional problems, likelihood ratios (and hence importance sampling) should be avoided. In this paper we introduce a new adaptive simulation approach that does away with likelihood ratios, while retaining the multi-level approach of the cross-entropy method. Like the latter, the method can be used for rare-event probability estimation, optimization, and counting. Moreover, the method allows one to sample exactly from the target distribution rather than asymptotically as in Markov chain Monte Carlo. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for a variety of applications.},

@article{BridgesEtAl_ActiveManifoldsNonlinear_2019,
	abstract = {We present an approach to analyze C1(Rm) functions that addresses limitations present in the Active Subspaces (AS) method of Constantine et al. (2015; 2014). Under appropriate hypotheses, our Active Manifolds (AM) method identifies a 1-D curve in the domain (the active manifold) on which nearly all values of the unknown function are attained, and which can be exploited for approximation or analysis, especially when m is large (high-dimensional input space). We provide theorems justifying our AM technique and an algorithm permitting functional approximation and sensitivity analysis. Using accessible, low-dimensional functions as initial examples, we show AM reduces approximation error by an order of magnitude compared to AS, at the expense of more computation. Following this, we revisit the sensitivity analysis by Glaws et al. (2017), who apply AS to analyze a magnetohydrodynamic power generator model, and compare the performance of AM on the same data. Our analysis provides detailed information not captured by AS, exhibiting the influence of each parameter individually along an active manifold. Overall, AM represents a novel technique for analyzing functional models with benefits including: reducing m-dimensional analysis to a 1-D analogue, permitting more accurate regression than AS (at more computational expense), enabling more informative sensitivity analysis, and granting accessible visualizations (2-D plots) of parameter sensitivity along the AM.},

	abstract = {Scientists and engineers rely on accurate mathematical models to quantify the objects of their studies, which are often high-dimensional. Unfortunately, high-dimensional models are inherently difficult, i.e. when observations are sparse or expensive to determine. One way to address this problem is to approximate the original model with fewer input dimensions. Our project goal was to recover a function f that takes n inputs and returns one output, where n is potentially large. For any given n-tuple, we assume that we can observe a sample of the gradient and output of the function but it is computationally expensive to do so. This project was inspired by an approach known as Active Subspaces, which works by linearly projecting to a linear subspace where the function changes most on average. Our research gives mathematical developments informing a novel algorithm for this problem. Our approach, Active Manifolds, increases accuracy by seeking nonlinear analogues that approximate the function. The benefits of our approach are eliminated unprincipled parameter, choices, guaranteed accessible visualization, and improved estimation accuracy.},

This paper proposes a modification of an algorithm proposed in literature for the efficient estimation of small failure probabilities, which combines FORM to an adaptive krigingbased importance sampling strategy (AK-IS). The modification allows overcoming an important limitation of the original AK-IS in that it provides the algorithm with the flexibility to deal with multiple failure regions characterized by complex, non-linear limit states. The modified algorithm is shown to offer satisfactory results with reference to four case studies of literature, outperforming in general several other alternative methods of literature.},

@article{ChanKroese_RareeventProbabilityEstimation_2011,
	abstract = {Estimation of rare-event probabilities in high-dimensional settings via importance sampling is a difficult problem due to the degeneracy of the likelihood ratio. In fact, it is generally recommended that Monte Carlo estimators involving likelihood ratios should not be used in such settings. In view of this, we develop efficient algorithms based on conditional Monte Carlo to estimate rare-event probabilities in situations where the degeneracy problem is expected to be severe. By utilizing an asymptotic description of how the rare event occurs, we derive algorithms that involve generating random variables only from the nominal distributions, thus avoiding any likelihood ratio. We consider two settings that occur frequently in applied probability: systems involving bottleneck elements and models involving heavytailed random variables. We first consider the problem of estimating P(X1 + {$\cdot$} {$\cdot$} {$\cdot$} + Xn {$>$} {$\gamma$} ), where X1, . . . , Xn are independent but not identically distributed (ind) heavy-tailed random variables. Guided by insights obtained from this model, we then study a variety of more general settings. Specifically, we consider a complex bridge network and a generalization of the widely popular normal copula model used in managing portfolio credit risk, both of which involve hundreds of random variables. We show that the same conditioning idea, guided by an asymptotic description of the way in which the rare event happens, can be used to derive estimators that outperform existing ones.},

If the two measures \textmu{} and {$\nu$} are nearly singular with respect to each other, which is often the case in practice, the sample size required for accurate estimation is large. In this article it is shown that in a fairly general setting, a sample of size approximately exp(D({$\nu$}||\textmu )) is necessary and sufficient for accurate estimation by importance sampling, where D({$\nu$}||\textmu ) is the Kullback\textendash Leibler divergence of \textmu{} from {$\nu$}. In particular, the required sample size exhibits a kind of cut-off in the logarithmic scale. The theory is applied to obtain a general formula for the sample size required in importance sampling for one-parameter exponential families (Gibbs measures).},

Global sensitivity analysis quantifies the importance of each input parameter, which can lead to insight into the model and reduced computational cost; commonly used sensitivity metrics include Sobol' total sensitivity indices and derivative-based global sensitivity measures. Active subspaces are part of an emerging set of tools for identifying important directions in a model's input parameter space; these directions can be exploited to reduce the model's dimension enabling otherwise infeasible parameter studies. In this paper, we develop global sensitivity metrics called activity scores from the active subspace, which yield insight into the important model parameters. We mathematically relate the activity scores to established sensitivity metrics, and we discuss computational methods to estimate the activity scores. We show two numerical examples with algebraic functions taken from simplified engineering models. For each model, we analyze the active subspace and discuss how to exploit the low-dimensional structure. We then show that input rankings produced by the activity scores are consistent with rankings produced by the standard metrics.},

	abstract = {The Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is the computational workhorse for Bayesian inverse problems. However, MCMC struggles in high-dimensional parameter spaces, since its iterates must sequentially explore the high-dimensional space. This struggle is compounded in physical applications when the nonlinear forward model is computationally expensive. One approach to accelerate MCMC is to reduce the dimension of the state space. Active subspaces are part of an emerging set of tools for subspace-based dimension reduction. An active subspace in a given inverse problem indicates a separation between a low-dimensional subspace that is informed by the data and its orthogonal complement that is constrained by the prior. With this information, one can run the sequential MCMC on the active variables while sampling independently according to the prior on the inactive variables. However, this approach to increase efficiency may introduce bias. We provide a bound on the Hellinger distance between the true posterior and its active subspaceexploiting approximation. And we demonstrate the active subspace-accelerated MCMC on two computational examples: (i) a two-dimensional parameter space with a quadratic forward model and one-dimensional active subspace and (ii) a 100-dimensional parameter space with a PDE-based forward model and a two-dimensional active subspace.},

The method approximates the probability of the rare event by means of a family of probabilistic models. The method has been extended to optimization, by considering an optimal event as a rare event. CE works rather good when dealing with deterministic function optimization. Now, it appears that two conditions are needed for a good convergence of the method. First, it is necessary to have a family of models sufficiently flexible for discriminating the optimal events. Indirectly, it appears also that the function to be optimized should be deterministic. The purpose of this paper is to consider the case of partially discriminating model family, and of stochastic functions. It will be shown on simple examples that the CE could fail when relaxing these hypotheses. Alternative improvements of the CE method are investigated and compared on random examples in order to handle this issue.},

Although the performance of a given simulation kernel can clarify a posteriori how adequate this kernel is for the problem at hand, a permanent on-line modification of kernels causes concerns about the validity of the resulting algorithm. While the issue is most often intractable for MCMC algorithms, the equivalent version for importance sampling algorithms can be validated quite precisely.

Adaptive importance sampling (AIS) implements an iterative version of IS, which adapts the parameters of the proposal distribution in order to improve estimation of the target. While the adaptation of the location (mean) of the proposals has been largely studied, an important challenge of AIS relates to the difficulty of adapting the scale parameter (covariance matrix). In the case of weight degeneracy, adapting the covariance matrix using the empirical covariance results in a singular matrix, which leads to a poor performance in subsequent iterations of the algorithm. In this letter, we propose a novel scheme which exploits recent advances in the IS literature to prevent the so-called weight degeneracy. The method efficiently adapts the covariance matrix of a population of proposal distributions and achieves a significant performance improvement in high-dimensional scenarios. We validate the new method through computer simulations.},

@article{ElviraEtAl_GeneralizedMultipleImportance_2019,
	abstract = {Importance sampling (IS) methods are broadly used to approximate posterior distributions or their moments. In the standard IS approach, samples are drawn from a single proposal distribution and weighted adequately. However, since the performance in IS depends on the mismatch between the targeted and the proposal distributions, several proposal densities are often employed for the generation of samples. Under this multiple importance sampling (MIS) scenario, extensive literature has addressed the selection and adaptation of the proposal distributions, interpreting the sampling and weighting steps in different ways. In this paper, we establish a novel general framework with sampling and weighting procedures when more than one proposal is available. The new framework encompasses most relevant MIS schemes in the literature, and novel valid schemes appear naturally. All the MIS schemes are compared and ranked in terms of the variance of the associated estimators. Finally, we provide illustrative examples revealing that, even with a good choice of the proposal densities, a careful interpretation of the sampling and weighting procedures can make a significant difference in the performance of the method.},

These methods are iterative in nature: at each step they generate samples from a proposal distribution and assign them weights according to the importance sampling principle. Critical issues in applying PMC methods are the choice of the generating functions for the samples and the avoidance of the sample degeneracy. In this paper, we propose three new schemes that considerably improve the performance of the original PMC formulation by allowing for better exploration of the space of unknowns and by selecting more adequately the surviving samples. A theoretical analysis is performed, proving the superiority of the novel schemes in terms of variance of the associated estimators and preservation of the sample diversity. Furthermore, we show that they outperform other state of the art algorithms (both in terms of mean square error and robustness w.r.t. initialization) through extensive numerical simulations.},

@article{ElviraSantamaria_MultipleImportanceSampling_2019,
	abstract = {Digital constellations formed by hexagonal or other non-square two-dimensional lattices are often used in advanced digital communication systems. The integrals required to evaluate the symbol error rate (SER) of these constellations in the presence of Gaussian noise are in general difficult to compute in closed form, and therefore Monte Carlo simulation is typically used to estimate the SER. However, naive Monte Carlo simulation can be very inefficient and requires very long simulation runs, especially at high signal-to-noise ratios. In this letter, we adapt a recently proposed multiple importance sampling technique, called ALOE (for ``at least one rare event''), to this problem. Conditioned to a transmitted symbol, an error (or rare event) occurs when the observation falls in a union of half-spaces or, equivalently, outside a given polytope. The proposal distribution for ALOE samples the system conditionally on an error taking place, which makes it more efficient than other importance sampling techniques. ALOE provides unbiased SER estimates with simulation times orders of magnitude shorter than conventional Monte Carlo.},

@article{GeyerEtAl_CrossEntropybasedImportance_2019,
	abstract = {The computation of the probability of a rare (failure) event is a common task in structural reliability analysis. In most applications, the numerical model defining the rare event is nonlinear and the resulting failure domain often multimodal. One strategy for estimating the probability of failure in this context is the importance sampling method. The efficiency of importance sampling depends on the choice of the importance sampling density. A near-optimal sampling density can be found through application of the cross entropy method. The cross entropy method is an adaptive sampling approach that determines the sampling density through minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the theoretically optimal importance sampling density and a chosen parametric family of distributions. In this paper, we investigate the suitability of the multivariate normal distribution and the Gaussian mixture model as importance sampling densities within the cross entropy method. Moreover, we compare the performance of the cross entropy method to sequential importance sampling, another recently proposed adaptive sampling approach, which uses the Gaussian mixture distribution as a proposal distribution within a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. For the parameter updating of the Gaussian mixture within the cross entropy method, we propose a modified version of the expectation-maximization algorithm that works with weighted samples. To estimate the number of distributions in the mixture, the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is adapted to the use of weighted samples. We compare the performance of the different methods in several examples, including component reliability problems, system reliability problems and reliability in varying dimensions. The results show that the cross entropy method using a single Gaussian outperforms the cross entropy method using Gaussian mixture and that both distribution types are not suitable for high dimensional reliability problems.},

	abstract = {Engineers increasingly use numerical model to replace the experimentations during the design of new products. With the increase of computer performance and numerical power, these models are more and more complex and time-consuming for a better representation of reality. In practice, optimization is very challenging when considering real mechanical problems since they exhibit uncertainties. Reliability is an interesting metric of the failure risks of design products due to uncertainties. The estimation of this metric, the failure probability, requires a high number of evaluations of the time-consuming model and thus becomes intractable in practice. To deal with this problem, surrogate modeling is used here and more specifically AK-based methods to enable the approximation of the physical model with much fewer time-consuming evaluations. The first objective of this thesis work is to discuss the mathematical formulations of design problems under uncertainties. This formulation has a considerable impact on the solution identified by the optimization during design process of new products. A definition of both concepts of reliability and robustness is also proposed. These works are presented in a publication in the international journal : Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization (Leli\`evre et al., 2016a). The second objective of this thesis is to propose a new AK-based method to estimate failure probabilities associated with rare events. This new method, named AK-MCSi, presents three enhancements of AK-MCS : (i) sequential Monte Carlo simulations to reduce the time associated with the evaluation of the surrogate model, (ii) a new stricter stopping criterion on learning evaluations to ensure the good classification of the Monte Carlo population and (iii) a multipoints enrichment permitting the parallelization of the evaluation of the time-consuming model. This work has been published in Structural Safety (Leli\`evre et al., 2018a). The last objective of this thesis is to propose new AK-based methods to estimate the failure probability of a high-dimensional reliability problem, i.e. a problem defined by both a time-consuming model and a high number of input random variables. Two new methods, AK-HDMR1 and AK-PCA, are proposed to deal with this problem based on respectively a functional decomposition and a dimensional reduction technique. AK-HDMR1 has been submitted to Reliability Enginnering and Structural Safety on 1st October 2018.},

	abstract = {In this work we present a new method of blackbox optimization and constraint satisfaction. Existing algorithms that have attempted to solve this problem are unable to consider multiple modes, and are not able to adapt to changes in environment dynamics. To address these issues, we developed a modified Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) that uses a masked auto-regressive neural network for modeling uniform distributions over the solution space. We train the model using maximum entropy policy gradient methods from Reinforcement Learning. Our algorithm is able to express complicated solution spaces, thus allowing it to track a variety of different solution regions. We empirically compare our algorithm with variations of CEM, including one with a Gaussian prior with fixed variance, and demonstrate better performance in terms of: number of diverse solutions, better mode discovery in multi-modal problems, and better sample efficiency in certain cases.},

The KL divergence between two Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) is frequently needed in the fields of speech and image recognition. Unfortunately the KL divergence between two GMMs is not analytically tractable, nor does any efficient computational algorithm exist. Some techniques cope with this problem by replacing the KL divergence with other functions that can be computed efficiently. We introduce two new methods, the variational approximation and the variational upper bound, and compare them to existing methods.

	abstract = {The popular use of response surface methodology accelerate the solutions of parameter identification and response analysis issues. However, accurate RSM models subject to aleatory and epistemic uncertainties are still challenging to construct, especially for multidimensional inputs, which is widely existed in real-world problems. In this study, an adaptive interval response surface methodology (AIRSM) based on extended active subspaces is proposed for mixed random and interval uncertainties. Based on the idea of subspace dimension reduction, extended active subspaces are given for mixed uncertainties and interval active variable representation is derived for the construction of AIRSM. A weighted response surface strategy is introduced and tested for predicting the accurate boundary. Moreover, an interval dynamic correlation index is defined, and significance check and cross validation are reformulated in active subspaces to evaluate the AIRSM. The effectiveness of AIRSM is demonstrated on two test examples: three-dimensional nonlinear function and speed reducer design. They both possess a dominant onedimensional active subspace with small estimation error and the accuracy of AIRSM is verified by comparing with full-dimensional Monte Carlo simulates, thus providing a potential template for tackling high-dimensional problems involving mixed aleatory and interval uncertainties.},

@article{JiangLi_HighDimensionalStructural_2017,
	abstract = {For the uncertainty quantification in structural dynamics, random simulate methods such as Monte Carlo Simulation, Probability Density Evolution Method (Le and Chen, 2009) and metamodel method (Hastie et al., 2005) [2] are extensively used because of their usability and universality. Unfortunately, the required computational resource for structural stochastic analysis is still a burdensome task especially structures are involved in nonlinearity and high dimensional uncertainty. The so called ``curse of dimension'' problem means the cost of performing a reliable reliability analysis increases exponentially with the dimension. In present paper, a supervised dimension reduction methodology named Active Subspace Method (Constantine, 2015) is introduced to deal with the high dimension problem of structural reliability. GF-discrepancy based point set is employed to exploit the hidden low-dimensional structure in the mapping from input to the quantity of interest (QOI), a kriging metamodel (Kaymaz, 2005) with higher accuracy and efficiency can be constructed on the low-dimensional subspace. Further, the extreme-value reliability of structure is calculated effectively by incorporating into probability density evolution method based extreme-value system reliability (Li et al., 2007). The proposed approach is then applied to a theoretical four branches system with two-dimensional random variable and a 6-DOF BoucWen nonlinear numerical model with 20-dimension random variable. The results show that the Active Subspace Kriging (ASK) method significantly improved the result of extreme-value reliability analysis for stochastic nonlinear structures, in which high dimensional randomness problem is involved.},

@article{KurtzSong_CrossentropybasedAdaptiveImportance_2013,
	abstract = {Structural reliability analysis frequently requires the use of sampling-based methods, particularly for the situation where the failure domain in the random variable space is complex. One of the most efficient and widely utilized methods to use in such a situation is importance sampling. Recently, an adaptive importance sampling method was proposed to find a near-optimal importance sampling density by minimizing Kullback\textendash Leibler cross entropy, i.e. a measure of the difference between the absolute best sampling density and the one being used for the importance sampling. In this paper, the adaptive importance sampling approach is further developed by incorporating a nonparametric multimodal probability density function model called the Gaussian mixture as the importance sampling density. This model is used to fit the complex shape of the absolute best sampling density functions including those with multiple important regions. An efficient procedure is developed to update the Gaussian mixture model toward a near-optimal density using a small size of pre-samples. The proposed method needs only a few steps to achieve a near-optimal sampling density, and shows significant improvement in efficiency and accuracy for a variety of component and system reliability problems. The method requires far less samples than both crude Monte Carlo simulation and the cross-entropy-based adaptive importance sampling method employing a unimodal density function; thus achieving relatively small values of the coefficient of variation efficiently. The computational efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method are not hampered by the probability level, dimension of random variable space, and curvatures of limit-state function. Moreover, the distribution model parameters of the Gaussian densities in the obtained near-optimal density help identify important areas in the random variable space and their relative importance.},

For largedimensional covariance matrices, the usual estimator\textemdash the sample covariance matrix\textemdash is typically not well-conditioned and may not even be invertible. This paper introduces an estimator that is both well-conditioned and more accurate than the sample covariance matrix asymptotically. This estimator is distribution-free and has a simple explicit formula that is easy to compute and interpret. It is the asymptotically optimal convex linear combination of the sample covariance matrix with the identity matrix. Optimality is meant with respect to a quadratic loss function, asymptotically as the number of observations and the number of variables go to infinity together. Extensive Monte Carlo confirm that the asymptotic results tend to hold well in finite sample.},

	abstract = {Quantum-informed ferroelectric phase field models capable of predicting material behavior, are necessary for facilitating the development and production of many adaptive structures and intelligent systems. Uncertainty is present in these models, given the quantum scale at which calculations take place. A necessary analysis is to determine how the uncertainty in the response can be attributed to the uncertainty in the model inputs or parameters. A second analysis is to identify active subspaces within the original parameter space, which quantify directions in which the model response varies most dominantly, thus reducing sampling effort and computational cost. In this investigation, we identify an active subspace for a poly-domain ferroelectric phase-field model. Using the active variables as our independent variables, we then construct a surrogate model and perform Bayesian inference. Once we quantify the uncertainties in the active variables, we obtain uncertainties for the original parameters via an inverse mapping. The analysis provides insight into how active subspace methodologies can be used to reduce computational power needed to perform Bayesian inference on model parameters informed by experimental or simulated data.},

However, the consistency of the AMIS estimator remains largely open. In this work we prove the convergence of the AMIS, at a cost of a slight modification in the learning process. Contrary to Douc et al.

Hence some of the results shed new light on adaptive population Monte Carlo algorithms in that last regime.},

This formula, EnSS, has become an essential piece within Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods, to assess the convenience of a resampling step. From another perspective, the expression n ESS is related to the Euclidean distance between the probability mass described by the normalized weights and the discrete uniform probability mass function (pmf). In this work, we derive other possible ESS functions based on different discrepancy measures between these two pmfs. Several examples are provided involving, for instance, the geometric mean of the weights, the discrete entropy (including the perplexity measure, already proposed in literature) and the Gini coefficient among others. We list five theoretical requirements which a generic ESS function should satisfy, allowing us to classify different ESS measures.

@article{MartinoEtAl_LayeredAdaptiveImportance_2017,
	abstract = {Monte Carlo methods represent the de facto standard for approximating complicated integrals involving multidimensional target distributions. In order to generate random realizations from the target distribution, Monte Carlo techniques use simpler proposal probability densities to draw candidate samples. The performance of any such method is strictly related to the specification of the proposal distribution, such that unfortunate choices easily wreak havoc on the resulting estimators. In this work, we introduce a layered (i.e., hierarchical) procedure to generate samples employed within a Monte Carlo scheme. This approach ensures that an appropriate equivalent proposal density is always obtained automatically (thus eliminating the risk of a catastrophic performance), although at the expense of a moderate increase in the complexity. Furthermore, we provide a general unified importance sampling (IS) framework, where multiple proposal densities are employed and several IS schemes are introduced by applying the so-called deterministic mixture approach. Finally, given these schemes, we also propose a novel class of adaptive importance samplers using a population of proposals, where the adaptation is driven by independent parallel or interacting Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains. The resulting algorithms efficiently combine the benefits of both IS and MCMC methods.},

The algorithm is then benchmarked on 13 well-known test functions in high dimension spaces (100 dimensions), and the answers are verified by a comparative study with thermal exchange optimization, selfish herds optimization, water evaporation optimization, Moth-Flame optimization, Flower Pollination Algorithm, states of matter search, and gray wolf optimizer. The results indicate that the MCEO algorithm can provide very competitive results in comparison to these well-known meta-heuristics in a similar condition (in term of NFEs). The paper also considers solving three classical engineering design problems (tension/compression spring, welded beam, and pressure vessel designs) and presents a genuine application of the proposed method to the field of dam engineering. The results of the classical engineering design problems and the real application validate that the proposed algorithm is applicable to challenging difficulties with unknown search spaces.},

For very seldom observed events, such as the collision probability between two aircraft in airspace, these approaches do not lead to accurate results. Indeed, the number of available samples is often insufficient to estimate such low probabilities (at least 106 samples are needed to estimate a probability of order 10\`A4 with 10\% relative error with Monte-Carlo simulations). In this article, one reviewed different appropriate techniques to estimate rare event probabilities that require a fewer number of samples. These methods can be divided into four main categories: parameterization techniques of probability density function tails, simulation techniques such as importance sampling or importance splitting, geometric methods to approximate input failure space and finally, surrogate modeling. Each technique is detailed, its advantages and drawbacks are described and a synthesis that aims at giving some clues to the following question is given: ``which technique to use for which problem?''. \'O 2014 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Simulated annealing\textemdash moving from a tractable distribution to a distribution of interest via a sequence of intermediate distributions\textemdash has traditionally been used as an inexact method of handling isolated modes in Markov chain samplers. Here, it is shown how one can use the Markov chain transitions for such an annealing sequence to define an importance sampler. The Markov chain aspect allows this method to perform acceptably even for high-dimensional problems, where finding good importance sampling distributions would otherwise be very difficult, while the use of importance weights ensures that the estimates found converge to the correct values as the number of annealing runs increases. This annealed importance sampling procedure resembles the second half of the previously-studied tempered transitions, and can be seen as a generalization of a recently-proposed variant of sequential importance sampling. It is also related to thermodynamic integration methods for estimating ratios of normalizing constants. Annealed importance sampling is most attractive when isolated modes are present, or when estimates of normalizing constants are required, but it may also be more generally useful, since its independent sampling allows one to bypass some of the problems of assessing convergence and autocorrelation in Markov chain samplers.},

The probability of failure can be estimated efficiently through importance sampling (IS), provided that an effective IS density is chosen. The cross entropy (CE) method is an adaptive sampling approach that determines the IS density through minimizing the Kullback\textendash Leibler divergence between the theoretically optimal IS density and a chosen parametric family of distributions. We propose an improved version of the classical CE method that introduces a smooth transition to make better use of the samples from intermediate sampling levels for fitting the sought IS density. The improved CE method is combined with a novel flexible parametric distribution model that is able to handle low- and high-dimensional problems as well as problems with multimodal failure domains. A set of numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed approach performs consistently better than the classical CE method in various problem settings.},

SIS was developed originally in the statistical community for exploring posterior distributions and estimating normalizing constants in the context of Bayesian analysis. The basic idea of SIS is to gradually translate samples from the prior distribution to samples from the posterior distribution through a sequential reweighting operation. In the context of structural reliability, SIS can be applied to produce samples of an approximately optimal importance sampling density, which can then be used for estimating the sought probability. The transition of the samples is defined through the construction of a sequence of intermediate distributions. We present a particular choice of the intermediate distributions and discuss the properties of the derived algorithm. Moreover, we introduce two MCMC algorithms for application within the SIS procedure; one that is applicable to general problems with small to moderate number of random variables and one that is especially efficient for tackling high-dimensional problems.},

	abstract = {This paper develops a comprehensive probabilistic setup to compute approximating functions in active subspaces. Constantine et al. proposed the active subspace method in [8] to reduce the dimension of computational problems. It can be seen as an attempt to approximate a high-dimensional function of interest f by a low-dimensional one. To do this, a common approach is to integrate f over the inactive, i. e. non-dominant, directions with a suitable conditional density function. In practice, this can be done with a finite Monte Carlo sum, making not only the resulting approximation random in the inactive variable for each fixed input from the active subspace, but also its expectation, i. e. the integral of the low-dimensional function weighted with a probability measure on the active variable. In this regard we develop a fully probabilistic framework extending results from [8, 10]. The results are supported by a simple numerical example.},

	abstract = {We present a method for estimating the KL divergence between continuous densities and we prove it converges almost surely. Divergence estimation is typically solved estimating the densities first. Our main result shows this intermediate step is unnecessary and that the divergence can be either estimated using the empirical cdf or k-nearest-neighbour density estimation, which does not converge to the true measure for finite k. The convergence proof is based on describing the statistics of our estimator using waiting-times distributions, as the exponential or Erlang. We illustrate the proposed estimators and show how they compare to existing methods based on density estimation, and we also outline how our divergence estimators can be used for solving the two-sample problem.},

Each stage t is formed with two steps : (i) to explore the space with nt points according to qt and (ii) to exploit the current amount of information to update the sampling policy. The very fundamental question raised in this paper concerns the behavior of empirical sums based on AIS. Without making any assumption on the allocation policy nt, the theory developed involves no restriction on the split of computational resources between the explore (i) and the exploit (ii) step. It is shown that AIS is asymptotically optimal : the asymptotic behavior of AIS is the same as some ``oracle'' strategy that knows the targeted sampling policy from the beginning. From a practical perspective, weighted AIS is introduced, a new method that allows to forget poor samples from early stages.},

In contrast to other generalized regression techniques that approximate conditional superquantiles by various combinations of conditional quantiles, we directly and in perfect analog to classical regression obtain superquantile regression functions as optimal solutions of certain error minimization problems. We show the existence and possible uniqueness of regression functions, discuss the stability of regression functions under perturbations and approximation of the underlying data, and propose an extension of the coefficient of determination R-squared for assessing the goodness of fit. The paper presents two numerical methods for solving the error minimization problems and illustrates the methodology in several numerical examples in the areas of uncertainty quantification, reliability engineering, and financial risk management.},

We use importance sampling as an important ingredient for adaptive adjustment of the temperature in the Boltzmann distribution and use Kullback-Leibler cross-entropy to \textregistered nd the optimal solution. In fact, we use the mode of a unimodal importance sampling distribution, like the mode of beta distribution, as an estimate of the optimal solution for continuous optimization and Markov chains approach for combinatorial optimization. In the later case we show almost surely convergence of our algorithm to the optimal solution. Supporting numerical results for both continuous and combinatorial optimization problems are given as well.

Traditional estimators based on the eigendecomposition of the sample covariance matrix are known to be consistent provided that the number of observations grow to infinity with respect to any other dimension in the signal model. On the contrary, in order to avoid the loss in the estimation accuracy associated with practical finite sample-size situations, a generalization of the conventional implementation is derived that proves to be a very good approximation for a sample-size and an array dimension that are comparatively large. The proposed solution is applied to the construction of a subspace-based extension of the Capon source power estimator. For our purposes, we resort to the theory of the spectral analysis of large dimensional random matrices, or random matrix theory. As it is shown via numerical simulations, the new estimator turns out to allow for a significantly improved estimation accuracy in practical finite sample-support scenarios.},

We derive a general bound that needs to hold for importance sampling to be successful, and relates the f -divergence between the target and the proposal to the sample size. The bound is deduced from a new and simple information theory paradigm for the study of importance sampling. As examples of the general theory we give necessary conditions on the sample size in terms of the Kullback-Leibler and {$\chi$}2 divergences, and the total variation and Hellinger distances. Our approach is non-asymptotic, and its generality allows to tell apart the relative merits of these metrics. Unsurprisingly, the nonsymmetric divergences give sharper bounds than total variation or Hellinger.

	abstract = {The efficient importance sampling (EIS) method is a general principle for the numerical evaluation of highdimensional integrals that uses the sequential structure of target integrands to build variance minimising importance samplers. Despite a number of successful applications in high dimensions, it is well known that importance sampling strategies are subject to an exponential growth in variance as the dimension of the integration increases. We solve this problem by recognising that the EIS framework has an offline sequential Monte Carlo interpretation. The particle EIS method is based on non-standard resampling weights that take into account the construction of the importance sampler as a sequential approximation to the state smoothing density. We apply the method for a range of univariate and bivariate stochastic volatility specifications. We also develop a new application of the EIS approach to state space models with Student's t state innovations. Our results show that the particle EIS method strongly outperforms both the standard EIS method and particle filters for likelihood evaluation in high dimensions. We illustrate the efficiency of the method for Bayesian inference using the particle marginal Metropolis\textendash Hastings and importance sampling squared algorithms.},

	abstract = {Abstract                            Motivation               Small P-values are often required to be accurately estimated in large-scale genomic studies for the adjustment of multiple hypothesis tests and the ranking of genomic features based on their statistical significance. For those complicated test statistics whose cumulative distribution functions are analytically intractable, existing methods usually do not work well with small P-values due to lack of accuracy or computational restrictions. We propose a general approach for accurately and efficiently estimating small P-values for a broad range of complicated test statistics based on the principle of the cross-entropy method and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling techniques.                                         Results               We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm through simulations and demonstrate its application to three real-world examples in genomic studies. The results show that our approach can accurately evaluate small to extremely small P-values (e.g. 10-6 to 10-100). The proposed algorithm is helpful for the improvement of some existing test procedures and the development of new test procedures in genomic studies.

@article{SunEtAl_RobustEstimationStructured_2016,
	abstract = {This paper considers the problem of robustly estimating a structured covariance matrix with an elliptical underlying distribution with a known mean. In applications where the covariance matrix naturally possesses a certain structure, taking the prior structure information into account in the estimation procedure is beneficial to improving the estimation accuracy. We propose incorporating the prior structure information into Tyler's M-estimator and formulating the problem as minimizing the cost function of Tyler's estimator under the prior structural constraint. First, the estimation under a general convex structural constraint is introduced with an efficient algorithm for finding the estimator derived based on the majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm framework. Then, the algorithm is tailored to several special structures that enjoy a wide range of applications in signal processing related fields, namely, sum of rank-one matrices, Toeplitz, and banded Toeplitz structure. In addition, two types of non-convex structures, i.e., the Kronecker structure and the spiked covariance structure, are also discussed, where it is shown that simple algorithms can be derived under the guidelines of MM. The algorithms are guaranteed to converge to a stationary point of the problems. Furthermore, if the constraint set is geodesically convex, such as the Kronecker structure set, then the algorithm converges to a global minimum. Numerical results show that the proposed estimator achieves a smaller estimation error than the benchmark estimators at a lower computational cost.},

Motivated by risk management principles, the primary intent is to provide ``cautious'' forecasts under uncertainty. The net effect on fitted models is to shape the residuals so that on average only a prespecified proportion of predictions tend to fall above or below a desired threshold. The loss functions are reformulated as objective functions in the context of parameter estimation for linear regression models, and it is demonstrated how optimization can be implemented via linear programming. The method is a competitor of quantile regression, but is more flexible and broader in scope. An application is illustrated on prediction of NDX and SPX index returns data, while controlling the magnitude of a fraction of worst losses.},

Different robustness properties of estimators have been defined in the literature. However, these properties are not adapted to estimators coming from a parametric family for which the optimal parameter is random due to a learning algorithm. These estimators have random accuracy. For this reason, we motivate in this paper the need to define probabilistic robustness properties. We especially focus on the so-called probabilistic bounded relative error property.

For correlation matrices of multivariate Gaussian variables we analytically determine the expected values of the Kullback-Leibler distance of a sample correlation matrix from a reference model and we show that the expected values are known also when the specific model is unknown. We propose to make use of the Kullback-Leibler distance to estimate the information extracted from a correlation matrix by correlation filtering procedures. We also show how to use this distance to measure the stability of filtering procedures with respect to statistical uncertainty. We explain the effectiveness of our method by comparing four filtering procedures, two of them being based on spectral analysis and the other two on hierarchical clustering. We compare these techniques as applied both to simulations of factor models and empirical data. We investigate the ability of these filtering procedures in recovering the correlation matrix of models from simulations. We discuss such an ability in terms of both the heterogeneity of model parameters and the length of data series. We also show that the two spectral techniques are typically more informative about the sample correlation matrix than techniques based on hierarchical clustering, whereas the latter are more stable with respect to statistical uncertainty.},

Parameter dimension reduction is accomplished by computing an active subspace that predominantly captures the variability in the quantity of interest (QoI). In the present work, we compute the active subspace for a H2/O2 mechanism that involves 19 chemical reactions, using an efficient iterative strategy. The active subspace is first computed for a 19-parameter problem wherein only the uncertainty in the pre-exponents of the individual reaction rates is considered. This is followed by the analysis of a 33-dimensional case wherein the activation energies are also considered uncertain. In both cases, a 1-dimensional active subspace is identified, which indicates enormous potential for efficient statistical analysis of complex chemical systems. In addition, we explore links between active subspaces and global sensitivity analysis, and exploit these links for identification of key contributors to the variability in the model response.},

By small-size pre-samplings, the proposed approach first finds a near-optimal sampling density by minimizing the Kullback\textendash Leibler cross entropy between a von Mises-Fisher mixture model and the absolute best importance sampling density. To facilitate the minimization process, updating rules for parameters of the von Mises-Fisher mixture model are derived. Various practical issues associated with the updating rules are discussed and heuristic rules to improve the performance of the importance sampling are introduced. At the stage of final sampling, two slightly different sampling strategies are proposed to provide analysis options. Three numerical examples are investigated to test and demonstrate the proposed importance sampling method. The numerical examples show that the proposed approach, applicable to both component and system reliability problems, has superior performance for high dimensional reliability analysis problems with low failure probabilities.},

We propose a unified framework for regularizing this estimate in order to improve its finite sample performance. Our approach is based on the discovery of hidden convexity within the ML objective. We begin by restricting the attention to diagonal covariance matrices. Using a simple change of variables, we transform the problem into a convex optimization that can be efficiently solved. We then extend this idea to nondiagonal matrices using convexity on the manifold of positive definite matrices. We regularize the problem using appropriately convex penalties. These allow for shrinkage towards the identity matrix, shrinkage towards a diagonal matrix, shrinkage towards a given positive definite matrix, and regularization of the condition number. We demonstrate the advantages of these estimators using numerical simulations.},

Naively applied, however, ASMs require gradient evaluations of the target function. In the event of noisy, expensive, or stochastic simulators, evaluating gradients via finite differencing may be infeasible. In such cases, often a surrogate model is employed, on which finite differencing is performed. When the surrogate model is a Gaussian process, we show that the ASM estimator is available in closed form, rendering the finite-difference approximation unnecessary. We use our closed-form solution to develop acquisition functions focused on sequential learning tailored to sensitivity analysis on top of ASMs. We also show that the traditional ASM estimator may be viewed as a method of moments estimator for a certain class of Gaussian processes. We demonstrate how uncertainty on Gaussian process hyperparameters may be propagated to uncertainty on the sensitivity analysis, allowing model-based confidence intervals on the active subspace. Our methodological developments are illustrated on several examples.},

To achieve the high efficiency, a sensitivity-guided cross-entropy (SCE) algorithm is introduced which integrates CE with a partitioning-based sampling strategy to effectively reduce the solution space in solving the large-scale decap budgeting problems. Compared to improved CG method and conventional CE method, SCE with Latin hypercube sampling method (SCELHS) can provide 2\texttimes{} speedups, while achieving up to 25\% improvement on power supply noise. To further improve decap optimization solution quality, SCE with sequential importance sampling (SCE-SIS) method is also studied and implemented. Compared to SCE-LHS, in similar runtime, SCE-SIS can lead to 16.8\% further reduction on the total power supply noise.},

@article{YangEtAl_SystemReliabilityAnalysis_2020,
	abstract = {System reliability analysis with small failure probability is investigated in this paper. Because multiple failure modes exist, the system performance function has multiple failure regions and multiple most probable points (MPPs). This paper reports an innovative method combining active learning Kriging (ALK) model with multimodal adaptive important sampling (MAIS). In each iteration of the proposed method, MPPs on a so-called surrogate limit state surface (LSS) of the system are explored, important samples are generated, optimal training points are chosen, the Kriging models are updated, and the surrogate LSS is refined. After several iterations, the surrogate LSS will converge to the true LSS. A recently proposed evolutionary multimodal optimization algorithm is adapted to obtain all the potential MPPs on the surrogate LSS, and a filtering technique is introduced to exclude improper solutions. In this way, the unbiasedness of our method is guaranteed. To avoid approximating the unimportant components, the training points are only chosen from the important samples located in the truncated candidate region (TCR). The proposed method is termed as ALK-MAIS-TCR. The accuracy and efficiency of ALK-MAIS-TCR are demonstrated by four complicated case studies.},

@article{ZahmEtAl_CertifiedDimensionReduction_2018,
	abstract = {We propose a dimension reduction technique for Bayesian inverse problems with nonlinear forward operators, non-Gaussian priors, and non-Gaussian observation noise. The likelihood function is approximated by a ridge function, i.e., a map which depends non-trivially only on a few linear combinations of the parameters. We build this ridge approximation by minimizing an upper bound on the Kullback\textendash Leibler divergence between the posterior distribution and its approximation. This bound, obtained via logarithmic Sobolev inequalities, allows one to certify the error of the posterior approximation. Computing the bound requires computing the second moment matrix of the gradient of the log-likelihood function. In practice, a sample-based approximation of the upper bound is then required. We provide an analysis that enables control of the posterior approximation error due to this sampling. Numerical and theoretical comparisons with existing methods illustrate the benefits of the proposed methodology.},

@article{ZahmEtAl_GradientbasedDimensionReduction_2018,
	abstract = {Multivariate functions encountered in high-dimensional uncertainty quantification problems often vary most strongly along a few dominant directions in the input parameter space. We propose a gradient-based method for detecting these directions and using them to construct ridge approximations of such functions, in the case where the functions are vector-valued (e.g., taking values in Rn). The methodology consists of minimizing an upper bound on the approximation error, obtained by subspace Poincar\textasciiacute e inequalities. We provide a thorough mathematical analysis in the case where the parameter space is equipped with a Gaussian probability measure. The resulting method generalizes the notion of active subspaces associated with scalar-valued functions. A numerical illustration shows that using gradients of the function yields effective dimension reduction. We also show how the choice of norm on the codomain of the function has an impact on the function's low-dimensional approximation.},

@inproceedings{ZulianiEtAl_RareeventVerificationStochastic_2012,
	abstract = {In this paper we address the problem of verifying in stochastic hybrid systems temporal logic properties whose probability of being true is very small \textemdash{} rare events. It is well known that sampling-based (Monte Carlo) techniques, such as statistical model checking, do not perform well for estimating rare-event probabilities. The problem is that the sample size required for good accuracy grows too large as the event probability tends to zero. However, several techniques have been developed to address this problem. We focus on importance sampling techniques, which bias the original system to compute highly accurate and efficient estimates. The main difficulty in importance sampling is to devise a good biasing density, that is, a density yielding a low-variance estimator. In this paper, we show how to use the cross-entropy method for generating approximately optimal biasing densities for statistical model checking. We apply the method with importance sampling and statistical model checking for estimating rare-event probabilities in stochastic hybrid systems coded as Stateflow/Simulink diagrams.},
